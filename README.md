<h1> JavaScript Calculator 🖩</h1>

> Status: Developed ✅✅✅

Calculator developed as example from "Curso Completo de JavaScript" by HCode na Udemy.com.

### Hi there, this is my first JavaScript project, you can try it, it's a responsible calculator. If you want the tab sound, need to click 'AC' twice.

Advices🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️:
- This calculator supports a maximum of 10-digit numbers, if you exceed this amount, will set "Error"
- You can press 'AC' twice if you want sound at press any button;
- This beautiful calculator makes all the stuff that a ordinary calc usually do, sum, subtraction, division, multiplication e percentage;
- Unfortanetly, it doesn't calculate cientific notation, sorry, I'm still a newba, who knows in the future 😊.

## Technologies used:
